<h1 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Project Idea</h1>
<h4 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Overview</h4>

<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
In the busy age that we live in, more and more work loads, daily tasks overloaded, our memories are often stretched to the limit of what we are physically able to remember. Many app developers have capitalised on this with simple task management applications being produced to help us keep track of what is done, doing or needs to be done. Amazing as they are, they are only as good as the user input going in, if you don’t input the task to begin with, then chances are it won’t get priority or that it is small enough to not warrant being included. This is what we want to draw attention to, two small items that may not seem to be the most important but often, when they are lost, we are lost.
</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Motivation </h4>

<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
I could not tell you the name of anyone that I knew that did not own a set of keys or carry a wallet or purse. I, myself tried for the longest time to live without either, but the wallet situation got messy and keys just kept on coming. Move to a new house, more keys. New job, more ID to take care of. So, to make sure that we know where these are at all times becomes increasingly important to stress and personal sanity. How many times have you been late for a train, bus, work, uber, anything and you are dashing round the house looking for your most valued items? The number of grey hairs alone that this could save per year is intangible.

Enter,

The “Where are my…?” fridge magnet.
</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Description</h4>

<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
A small magnetic device, ideal of mounting on a refrigerator door or storing in a top drawer of office desk, or kept safe within a bedside nightstand. As not to continuously drain battery power when not in use, it will have an on/off switch. This rechargeable battery-operated device consists of two pre-programmed buttons that have been linked with their partnered items. Both buttons are programmed to generate a noise from their corresponding element. ‘Button 1’ is linked to a small audio producing speaker in the form of a keyring. This keyring will have a micro-USB charging port for rechargeable applications and aim to minimise battery waste contributing to landfill. Standard keyrings will be issued with initial devices but will look to viability of producing orders for customisable keychains if project becomes a success.
‘Button 2’ will be linked to a small card shaped audio producing device, again with rechargeable capabilities in the for of micro-USB. The second device is designed to be stored within a purse or wallet without being too imposing or bulky that its imposition outweighs any benefits that it provides.
The logic behind the production of this device is that these two daily items only seem to go missing when we need them the most. For the base entry level device, it is targeted to house hold use and locating the specific items when missing. The range will be 30 metres with the aim to increase this further down the track if it becomes viable to evolve this project into locating lost or stolen items with the inclusion of GPS locaters.

<h4 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Tools and Technologies</h4>

<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
Here at Tech International, we aren’t looking to reinvent the wheel, simply customise, reapply, find more practicality for already produced technologies. Using the age-old technology of the common house hold door bell, we are able to produce this revolutionary “Where are my…?” device. The magnetic master device, will consist of a very basic transmitter circuit with two push buttons. Each button will trigger the corresponding receiver to produce a sound.
For transmitter to work the following components are required
1. HT12E IC
2. 434 Mhz rf transmitter
3. 18 pin ic base optional
4. 1 megaohms resistor
5. 10k resistro
6. pushbutton
7. 3.7v battery or 5v power supply
8. jumper wires

For the receiver to work the following components are required
1. HT12D IC 2.
2. 434 Mhz rf receiver
3. bc 547 transistor
4. 1k resistor*2 5. 51k resistor
6. led
7. 9v battery or any 9v or 12v power supply
8. buzzer 9v or 6v or 12v
9. 18 pin ic base optional
10. jumper wires

<h4 style="font-family:Bahnschrift;">Basic build demonstration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlPBqya5bkc"></a> </h4>

<h4 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Skills Required</h4>

<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
For the ground level entry of this project, minimal software programming is required. A brief technical understanding of transmitters and receivers is needed as well as soldering components together to get both of these items to work.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Outcome</h4>

<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
If the project becomes successful, recognisably it won’t solve world famine or cure disease but that is not our aim. This device is targeted towards stress prevention for busy individuals. Knowing our target market, we would look to expand on the base application to include phones or implementing a switch that can double or triple the amount of linked audio broadcasting devices to the master unit. Even further down the line, look to include customisable keychains and GPS elements for lost keys, stolen wallets.</p>
