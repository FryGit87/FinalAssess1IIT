<h1 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Nationality</h1>
<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
My personal nationality is Australian. I’m first generation here as my parents were both born in England and came across on the boats for 10 pounds as very young children, or as they refer to themselves as ’10-pound poms’. This gave me a slightly different upbringing I feel as the English side tend to be noticeably prominent in things such as my values and my humour.
</p>

<h1 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Languages</h1>
<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
English is the only language that I speak fluently but over the years through different mediums and teachers have gathered a small knowledge of a few other languages that may not be enough for stable conversation, but definitely enough to live day to day in these countries. French is the first one that I began to learn but always found quite difficult to grasp and realised that it was like most other skills, if not used regularly, practiced, then it will begin to deteriorate and definitely not improve. The second language I feel confident with is Spanish, which began from years working at an Argentinean restaurant. I was surrounded by South American nationals that found in the fast pace of the restaurant, it was easier to resort to their mother tongue, so I decided to begin to learn some words, then some phrases. As I was able to regularly practice, it Improved, especially through the wonderful world of IT where I could download a pocket teacher to my phone in the way of DuoLingo and practice whenever I had 5-10 minutes spare.

<h1 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Background (Brief)</h1>
<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
After completing my schooling, I entered into an automotive mechanic apprenticeship. After successfully gaining my qualification and spending 5 years in the industry, I set my sights on travelling. I spent time moving through Europe, UK, US and Asia which began my interest into the hospitality industry. Upon returning to Australia, I pursued this new found interest into a new career path. Completing a few short courses and working within the industry, I quickly found my new heading. Long story short, saved for another time, I ended up opening my own places. Seven years later, feeling like I have achieved what I set out to initially, it is time to chase to hurdles, tackle more challenges, solve more problems that affect more than just a hungry stomach.
</p>

<h1 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Pastime</h1>
<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
Pre-owning a restaurant, I was often up late at night following the English Premier League or soccer as we know it here in Australia. However, hospitality hours can be rough especially when you are the one responsible for operations. Until recently there has been very little pastimes but have no eased up on the work and begun to enjoy the fruits of my labour. I have since begun to play a few online games here and there but nothing too crazy now that Uni has begun.
</p>

<h1 style="font-family:Arial Black;">IT Interest</h1>
<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;"><br>
My initial IT interest begun when I was quite young. My father and I would build hoppy computers like jigsaws when I was 10 years old. This is what sparked my interest as quite a young child. Years on, I went on to seek out work experience in a computer repair shop not far from where I lived. So excited, to hear that they would be happy to host a work experience participant, share their knowledge and teachings with someone so willing to learn. I was wrong, this was a week of sweeping and plastic wrapping boxes to be sold in the front shop. Nothing computer related and it had temporarily dampened my drive.
</p>

<h1 style="font-family:Arial Black;">RMIT</h1>
<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
I chose RMIT because I am a firm believer in the old saying ‘Jack of all trades, master of none’. So many times, in my past, in travels, in mechanics, in the hospitality industry, I have had this reinforced into me. Not simply by someone repeating the words but seeing people’s actions, how they excel at one task but fall at others. This is why I selected a University that specialises and excels in IT.
</p>

<h1 style="font-family:Arial Black;">Expectations</h1>
<p style="font-size:120%; font-family:Candara;">
These studies are the beginning of a new career for me. I’m looking to garner new skills that will be much more sort after in future industries whether they exist yet or not. Initially I had interests in cyber security pathways but being so early on in the topic, I really like to keep both my mind and options open when it comes to deciding which direction I would like to take. As we cover more topics, I think it will be a lot easier to make a choice like this with a more informed decision.
